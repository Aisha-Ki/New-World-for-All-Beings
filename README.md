This mini-ethnography explores **Full Circle Farm Sanctuary’s** (FCFS) anti-speciesist approach to food justice, land stewardship, and youth education. Through immersive participant observation and both qualitative and quantitative data collection, the research covers topics such as community building, labor rights, transformative education, and fundraising as acts of new-world building.

The sanctuary is a living example of how **human and nonhuman liberation** is deeply intertwined, as systems of patriarchy, racism and sexual violence are imposed onto species through an overarching structure of commodification and colonialism. This work centers animals not as passive tools, but as sentient co-inhabitants in a world reimagined beyond capitalist extraction, slaughter, and colonial food systems.
